        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p><strong>Hello and Namaskarams!</strong> Myself <b>Shivani</b>. I am currently pursuing my <b>Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics and Data Science</b>. Numbers and data have always fascinated me, and I love discovering patterns that help solve real-world problems.</p>

        <p>I have always been deeply passionate about <b>Indian classical music and Indian instrumental music</b>. The mesmerizing melodies of classical ragas and the intricate rhythms of instruments like the sitar, veena, and tabla inspire me. The depth and discipline required to master classical music resonate with my approach to lifeâ€”structured yet expressive. Exploring different ragas and their emotional nuances gives me a sense of peace and creativity.</p>

        <p>Apart from music, I have a keen interest in <b>Sanskrit and mathematics</b>. Sanskrit, with its precise grammar and rich literary heritage, fascinates me. The beauty of its structure reminds me of the logic found in mathematics, a subject I deeply admire. Solving mathematical problems and understanding complex theorems is something I truly enjoy. The elegance and logical flow of both Sanskrit and mathematics make them integral parts of my intellectual curiosity.</p>

        <p>My love for <b>coding in Python and Java</b> stems from my appreciation for logical problem-solving. Writing efficient and well-structured code gives me immense satisfaction. Pythonâ€™s simplicity and versatility, along with Javaâ€™s robustness, make them my favorite programming languages. Whether it's developing applications, working on algorithms, or exploring new frameworks, I find great joy in programming and continuously improving my skills.</p>
